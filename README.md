# Battery Aging Analysis with the NASA Battery Dataset

This project analyzes the aging process of Li-ion batteries using data from the NASA Battery Dataset. The analysis focuses on the evolution of key battery parameters such as **Battery Impedance (Re)** and **Charge Transfer Resistance (Rct)** over multiple charge/discharge cycles.

## Files
- `data_analysis.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook with the analysis code.
- `metadata.csv`: The dataset containing battery test data.
- `Analysis_report`: contains all the details about the process.

## Instructions
1. Clone this repository.
2. Install necessary dependencies (e.g., `pandas`, `plotly`).
3. Run the analysis in `data_analysis.ipynb`.
4. The graphs will be plot using ploty as you can easily access them and download them as well.
